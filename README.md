# PC-Price-Checker
A lightweight price-watcher for PC parts that: - checks multiple official price sources (PriceAPI / Geizhals, Keepa for Amazon, SerpApi for Google Shopping) - stores price history in Supabase - sends email alerts via MailerSend - runs scheduled checks via GitHub Actions (no paid server required)
